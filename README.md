## A Game Theoretic Approach For Rendering Immersive Experiences In The Metaverse

Abstract: The Metaverse is an upcoming computing paradigm aiming towards blending reality 1
seamlessly with the artificially generated 3D worlds of deep cyberspace. This giant interactive mesh 2
of three dimensionally reconstructed realms, has recently received tremendous attention from both an 3
academic and commercial point of view owing to the curiosity instilled by its vast possible use cases. 4
Every virtual world in the Metaverse is controlled and maintained by a Virtual Service Provider 5
(VSP). Interconnected clusters of LiDAR sensors act as a feeder network to these VSPs which then 6
process the data and reconstruct the best quality immersive environment possible. This data can then 7
be leveraged to provide users with highly targeted virtual services by building upon the concept of 8
digital twins (DTs) representing digital analogs of real-world items owned by parties that create and 9
establish the communication channels connecting the DT to its real-world counterpart. Logically, DTs 10
represent data on servers which post-processing, can be shared easily across VSPs, giving rise to new 11
marketplaces and economic frontiers. This paper presents a dynamic and distributed framework to 12
enable high quality reconstructions based on incoming data streams from sensors as well as to allow 13
for the optimal allocation of VSPs to users. The optimal synchronization intensity control problem 14
between the available VSPs and the feeder network is modeled using a simultaneous differential 15
game, while the allocation of VSPs to users has been modeled using a preference based game theoretic 16
approach, where the users give strict preferences over the available VSPs
